SingSong!
==============

SingSong is an app that I wrote for my NYU iPhone programming class Spring 2012.

It has a pretty simple workflow:
1) choose a song from the user's iTunes music library.
2) shoot a video from the while the music video plays in the background

The user then can export the video straight to the photo library.

It's pretty fun to use, and it's a fun thing to play around with!

Feel free to poke around and run the code.
